# FA_API_simple_demo
A simple demo querying a Pure Storage FlashArray using it's rest API


This demo allows simple querying of the FA to show the volumes & snapshots.

It is meant as a simple educational demo for APIs in general.

To use, copy the files and JS folder onto a webserver, the webserver will need access to a FlashArray and a user to authenticate as (although the application is read-only it may be worth creating a read-only user on the array for the application to use).
